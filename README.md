This repository is dedicated to the Binary Trees project where the following concepts are tested:<br>
* What is a binary tree<br>
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree<br>
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists<br>
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree<br>
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree<br>
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree<br>
